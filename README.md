# Ultimate_25k-_Matches_Football_Analysis

In this project I was analyzing European Soccer National Leagues. I performed EDA (Exploratary Data Analysis), did Inferential Statistics part
and in the end Machine Learning part, where the goal was to predict which team is going to win and how many goals each team is going to score.
